BALTRAD WRWP is completly dependent on a working RAVE installation so refer
to RAVEs installation instructions before installing BALTRAD WRWP.
You will also have to install LAPACK, BLAS and CBLAS for the numeric calculations.

When you have successfully installed RAVE, LAPACK, BLAS and CBLAS, you should 
only need to perform the traditional configure, make, make install.

%> ./configure --prefix=/opt/baltrad/baltrad-wrwp --with-rave=/opt/baltrad/rave --with-lapack=... --with-cblas=....
%> make
%> make test
%> make install
